Solutions by Fabian Siegel

## About

Last year I started to solve the puzzles of the
[advent of code 2018...](https://adventofcode.com/2018)
failing at day 7. This year, I try to be more successful to solve
[this years puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

## Languages

I try to solve everything in ´golang´, but will propably fall back to ´python´,
if its going to be to hard...
